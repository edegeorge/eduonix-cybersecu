Objective : Release of a new product

Sensitive points :
- software reactivity
- ergonomics of the application
- data follow-up after use of the software
Current processes and tools :
- weekly meeting on the progress of the project
- deadlines fixed for the release of the first version, the tests and the final version
- code editors, git


Identified gaps: unclear planning, testing only at the end of the first release and not continuously

Improvements

1. Break the project into several independent functionalities
2. Add continuous testing during the development of each feature
3. Customer testing and feedback to continue the continuous improvement of the product
4. Continuous monitoring of application performance and server load
5. Adjustment of monitoring alerts
